NUS Downloader, or NUSD, is a PC Utility designed to allow easy access to the resources present on Nintendo's Update Servers.

This program requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0. Source is available (GPLv3) if you desire to port it away from this prerequisite.

Load the program, and enter a title ID and optionally a specific version number. Title IDs can be found in the WiiBrew Title database and IOS History pages, or loaded from the included database file.

Check whether you wish to Pack the title into a WAD, and whether the title is for the Wii or DSi. Note that DSi titles cannot be packed into WADs (They could but it would be useless).

Check whether you wish to Decrypt the contents. This will create separate ".app" files in the same directory as the encrypted ones. You need a key.bin file in order for decryption to display.

Run the download, and you should be presented with the downloaded files and optionally a packed WAD in a folder named after the title ID you chose. All folders/files are saved in the directory that the main program is in.

System WADs can be installed using any normal installer.
